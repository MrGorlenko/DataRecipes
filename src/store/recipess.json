(if ice cream is too soft, put back in freezer for a few minutes -- but DON''T LET PIE THAW or the layers will run together!) After adding the second ice cream layer, freeze again until set.**Spread on a layer of whipped topping, and garnish top with chocolate sprinkles. Return pie to freezer until ready to serve.**'",

   "Directions": "To begin the starter, mix together 1 1/4 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups water, 1/2 teaspoon malt and 1/2 teaspoon of honey. Mix well, cover and leave at room temperature for 24 hours. Repeat the process for days 2 and three.**On day four, add to the starter: 7 1/2 cups of flour, 4 1/4 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of malt. Mix well, cover and keep at room temperature for 24 hours. Repeat this process the next day,  BUT only let the dough sit for 5 hours, then refrigerate it. Be aware that your starter will stay usable for 5 days. After this period, you will have to refresh the starter by taking 2 pounds of the batter and starting again from day 4.**At last, the starter is complete and now we can make the bread! In a large bowl or in the bowl of a 5 quart stand  mixer, combine 2 1/2 cups of the starter, 5 1/8 cups of bread flour, 1 1/2 cups water, 1/4 cup gluten, 2 teaspoons malt and 4 teaspoons of salt. Mix everything together into a uniform dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until elastic, about 15 minutes. In an electric mixer, it should take about 9 minutes. For more experienced bread bakers, the dough should pass the windowpane test: Stretch the dough between your fingers till you have a very thin membrane, if the dough is elastic enough the membrane will not break or tear apart. Cover the bowl with a towel and let rest for 30 minutes.**Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into rounds. Cover again and let rest for 1 hour.**Grease any pans you wish to use. Give the loaves their final shape - loaves, baguettes or round and place onto the prepared pans. Let the loaves rise until double in size. Spritz with water occasionally to keep from drying. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (240 degrees C).  Spray loaves generously with water.**Bake for about 45 minutes, or until the loaf makes a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom. If after 20 minutes the loaves appear to be taking on too much color, reduce the temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). After baking, cool loaves on a wire rack. BON APPETIT!**",

If not, return them to the oven for an additional 10 minutes or until they are done.  The peppers and garlic will take longer, and are done when the skins on the peppers are black and garlic is dark brown (no more than 40 minutes total).**Once everything has been roasted, place the potatoes in a large bowl and seal the peppers in a plastic bag to let them steam for 10 minutes.

Add to the bowl with the potatoes and stir to mix.**Turn the garlic heads upside down and squeeze the softened garlic past into a separate, small bowl.  Mix in the balsamic vinegar, 1/3 cup olive oil and oregano until smooth.  Pour the dressing onto the potatoes and peppers and toss to coat.  Season to taste with additional salt and pepper.

Fold 1/3 of the egg whites into the cheese mixture, then quickly fold in the remaining whites until no streaks remain. Be careful not to deflate the whites as much as possible.

Refrigerate.**In a large bowl, mix together the dry yeast and 3 cups of the remaining flour. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, sugar and salt. Heat to 115 degrees F (43 degrees C), or just warm, but not hot to the touch. Mix the warm milk mixture into the flour and yeast along with the eggs, and lemon and almond extracts. Stir for 3 minutes. Knead in the remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time until the dough is firm and pliable. Set aside to rest until double in size.**Cut the dough in half, and roll each half out to a 14 inch square. Place one sheet of the cold butter onto each piece of dough, and fold the dough over it like the cover of a book. Seal edges by pressing with fingers. Roll each piece out to a 20x 12 inch rectangle, then fold into thirds by folding the long sides in over the center. Repeat rolling into a large rectangle, and folding into thirds. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.**Remove from the refrigerator one at a time, and roll and fold each piece two more times. Return to the refrigerator to chill again before shaping. If the butter gets too warm, the dough will become difficult to manage.**To make danishes, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. The dough can be cut into squares, with a filling placed in the center. Fold 2 of the corners over the center to form a filled diamond shape. Or, fold the piece in half, cut into 1 inch strips, stretch, twist and roll into a spiral. Place a dollop of preserves or other filling in the center. Place danishes on an ungreased baking sheet, and let rise until doubled. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Danishes can be brushed with egg white for a shiny finish.**Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bottoms are golden brown.**",
